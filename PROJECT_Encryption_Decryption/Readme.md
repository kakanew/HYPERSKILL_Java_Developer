## PROJECT: Encryption-Decryption

##### About

Privacy is an important matter is the realm of the Internet. When sending a message, you want to be sure that no-one but the addressee with the key can read it. The entirety of the modern Web is encrypted - take https for example! Donâ€™t stay behind: hop on the encryption/decryption train and learn the essential basics while implementing this simple project.

##### Learning outcomes

Gradually get familiar with *Java*, paying special attention to working with files and the command line.
