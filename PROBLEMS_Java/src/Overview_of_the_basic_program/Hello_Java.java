package Overview_of_the_basic_program;

//Write a simple program that includes the main method.
//        Your class must be named Main if it is public; otherwise, it may have any name. It's a restriction of the platform, not Java.
//        The program should print the following text:
//        Hello, Java!

public class Hello_Java {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Cassia!");
    }
